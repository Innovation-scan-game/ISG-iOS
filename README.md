# ISG-iOS
The front-end for iOS

This is the IOS version of the application Cardisc. Cardisc is a digitized card game and the final product of project group 12 of the computer science program of InHolland University of Applied Sciences. The application works on the basis of cards that can be created and edited in a Web CMS environment. 

Real-time communication is provided by SignalR, using a client designed by Moozzyk to generate real-time responses for an IOS application. The link to this library is at the bottom of this readme.

Optionally, this application/tool could be used to gather information on various topics in a pleasant way. Information from multiple choice, agree/disagree and open-ended questions, among others.

Version number 1.01 (beta)
